The barrel length ended up making them rather cumbersome to use, so many examples had their barrels cut down, and later production versions had a shorter 155 mm barrel, giving a total length of 247 mm.

Short versions can be distinguished from later variants by their smaller trigger guard, though mystery hybrid models with later versions are known to exist.",

Finnish Army used them in machinegun-version of Renault FT-17 tanks in 1937 - 1943 and as a coaxial turret machinegun in Vickers 6-ton tanks in 1939 - 1940. They used similar disintegrating steel ammunition belts as ItKk/31 VKT anti-aircraft machinegun. The version used in Renault FT 17 was with right side feed, while the one used with Vickers 6-ton tanks was fed from the left side. But since the side from which the individual machinegun was fed with ammunition belts could be changed from one side to another in seconds by simply replacing the feed block of the machinegun, there was not much practical difference between the two versions. One would suspect that the high rate of fire (900 rounds/minute) combined with air-cooling might have caused some problems with overheating, but apparently these were not reported during their short service career. Instead a notably reported problem was unreliability of ammunition belt feed when used in Vickers 6-ton tanks - this seems to have been at least partly due to too long distance between ammunition belt box (attached to left side wall of the tank turret) and the machinegun. When Finnish Army equipped remaining Vickers 6-ton tanks with captured Soviet weapons around 1940 - 1941, all 762 Maxim M/09-31 tank machineguns were replaced with Soviet 7.62-mm DT machineguns.",
